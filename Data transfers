#notes on submitting data to NCBI via Scinet
#dont forget to get an aspera key from NCBI via the link below:
#Key is already downloaded to home directory: ~/aspera.openssh
#Log in to DTN node
#navigate to data directory and run
#remember data needs to be in a file folder. individual files don't work

ascp -i ~/aspera.openssh -QT -l100m -k1 -d <file path to data> subasp@upload.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:uploads/nathan.wyatt_usda.gov_68Y3cHAN &> log.txt &

#after running the above command type "disown" and the command will run until complete regardless of login status


That should upload the data and should create a "log" file that holds the stdout results. 

#getting data from novogene

wget -r -c ftp://<UserAccount>:<Password>@usftp21.novogene.com:21/ 2>log &

#create md5 for files
md5sum --tag <file/directory> > <output.md5>

#verify a download with md5 

md5sum -c <md5 file> &>nw_checksum.txt &

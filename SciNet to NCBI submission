#notes on submitting data to NCBI via Scinet
#dont forget to get an aspera key from NCBI via the link below:
#Key is already downloaded to home directory: ~/aspera.openssh
#Log in to DTN node
#navigate to data directory and run

ascp - i ~/aspera.openssh -QT -l100m -k1 -d <file path to data> <submission address given during ncbi submission> 2>log &

That should upload the data and should create a "log" file that holds the stdout results.

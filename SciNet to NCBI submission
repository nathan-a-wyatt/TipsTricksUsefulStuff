#notes on submitting data to NCBI via Scinet
#dont forget to get an aspera key from NCBI via the link below:
#Key is already downloaded to home directory: ~/aspera.openssh
#Log in to DTN node
#navigate to data directory and run
#remember data needs to be in a file folder. individual files don't work

ascp - i ~/aspera.openssh -QT -l100m -k1 -d <file path to data> subasp@upload.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:uploads/nathan.wyatt_usda.gov_68Y3cHAN &> log.txt

That should upload the data and should create a "log" file that holds the stdout results.
